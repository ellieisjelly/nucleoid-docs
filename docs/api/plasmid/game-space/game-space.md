### addPlayerFilter(Predicate&lt;[PlayerRef](../util/player-ref.md)&gt;)

---
Adds a player filter that gets applied whenever a player joins the gamespace. Applied before any game activity specific filtering. If the predicate returns `true`, the player is allowed to join or `false` otherwise

### removePlayerFilter(Predicate&lt;[PlayerRef]&gt;)

---
Removes the player filter from being applied. Needs to be the same reference, or else the equality check fails.

### isPlayerAllowed(PlayerRef)

### setActivity(Consumer&lt;[GameActivity](../game-activity.md)&gt;)

Replaces the old [GameActivity](../game-activity.md) with the one provided by the consumer. The old activity gets closed and all players get removed. After this, the sequence of events that get triggered are:  
* [GameActivityEvents.CREATE](../events/game-activity-events.md#create)
* [GamePlayerEvents.ADD](../events/game-player-events.md#add) for every player in the GameSpace
* [GameActivityEvents.ENABLE](../events/game-activity-events.md#enable)

### requestStart()

---
Submits a request to start the game. What this request means is game-dependant, and games may choose to not listen to this event at all unless they want to respond to the `/game start` command or the [WaitingLobby](../waiting-lobby/waiting-lobby.md).  
Returns a [GameResult](../data/game-result.md) that describes whether the game has started successfully or not.

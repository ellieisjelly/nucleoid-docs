# Game Config
A Game Config is a specific variation of a [GameType](../game-type.md), what this means is very game-specific, but it is expected that games utilize GameConfigs to change game behaviour in a data-driven way, such as changing maps or adding different game mechanics.  
You are not meant to instantiate this class in code, but rather use datapacks to store them based on a given Codec. You can define what Codec a GameConfig will use to parse when creating your [GameType](../game-type.md)

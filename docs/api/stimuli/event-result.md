# Event Result
Represents whether this event will change in response to the event listener.  
Has three values:
### ALLOW
Indicates the event should cancel further processing and allow the behavior to occur

### PASS
Nothing is changed, the event should continue processing the next listener

### DENY
Indicates the event should cancel further processing and deny the behavior to occur

---

Returning any of these when listening to an event is what determines the control flow of the event.
